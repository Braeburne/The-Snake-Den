## Arrays

### Overview
- A contiguous block of memory to store elements of the same type.
- Elements are accessed by their index.

### Advantages
- **Constant-time access**: Accessing elements by index is \(O(1)\).
- **Efficient memory usage**: No overhead like pointers.
- **Cache-friendly**: Sequential memory access improves performance on modern CPUs.

### Disadvantages
- **Fixed size**: Must define the size at allocation (unless using dynamic arrays).
- **Insertion/Deletion**: Operations in the middle of the array take \(O(n)\) due to shifting elements.
- **No flexibility**: Size is not automatically adjustable.

### Use Cases
- Random access to data (e.g., lookup tables).
- Implementing other data structures (e.g., heaps, dynamic arrays).

---

## Linked Lists

### Overview
- A collection of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next (or previous for doubly linked lists).

### Advantages
- **Dynamic size**: Can grow and shrink as needed.
- **Efficient insertions/deletions**: Adding or removing nodes is \(O(1)\) if the position is known.

### Disadvantages
- **Slow access**: Accessing elements requires traversal, \(O(n)\).
- **Memory overhead**: Each node requires extra memory for the pointer.

### Use Cases
- Implementing stacks and queues.
- Managing fragmented memory allocations.

---

## Stacks

### Overview
- A LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.

### Advantages
- **Simple operations**: Push and pop are \(O(1)\).
- **Reversibility**: Useful for undo operations or parsing.

### Disadvantages
- **Limited access**: Can only access the top element.
- **Overflow risk**: Fixed-size stacks require monitoring.

### Use Cases
- Function calls (call stack).
- Expression evaluation and parsing.

---

## Queues

### Overview
- A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.

### Advantages
- **Efficient ordering**: Handles operations where order matters.
- **Simple operations**: Enqueue and dequeue are \(O(1)\).

### Disadvantages
- **Limited access**: Can only access the front and rear elements.

### Use Cases
- Job scheduling.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS).

---

## Hash Tables

### Overview
- A key-value store using a hash function for fast lookups.

### Advantages
- **Fast access**: Average-case \(O(1)\) for search, insertion, and deletion.
- **Dynamic size**: Can grow to accommodate data.

### Disadvantages
- **Collisions**: Need collision resolution strategies (e.g., chaining, open addressing).
- **Space overhead**: Requires extra space for hash function and collision management.

### Use Cases
- Caching (e.g., memoization).
- Lookup tables.

---

## Trees

### Overview
- A hierarchical data structure with nodes, where each node has children.

### Types of Trees
1. **Binary Trees**: Each node has at most two children.
2. **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**: Nodes are arranged to support fast searching.
3. **Balanced Trees (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Trees)**: Maintains balance to ensure \(O(\log n)\) operations.

### Advantages
- **Hierarchical representation**: Natural fit for hierarchical data.
- **Efficient search**: \(O(\log n)\) for balanced trees.

### Disadvantages
- **Unbalanced trees**: Can degrade to \(O(n)\) if not balanced.
- **Complex implementation**: Balancing trees can be tricky.

### Use Cases
- Databases (e.g., B-trees for indexing).
- Routing and hierarchical data.

---

## Heaps

### Overview
- A special tree-based structure where the parent is always greater (max-heap) or smaller (min-heap) than its children.

### Advantages
- **Fast access to extremes**: Get the min or max in \(O(1)\).
- **Efficient insertions**: Insertions and deletions are \(O(\log n)\).

### Disadvantages
- **Limited use cases**: Only supports specific operations efficiently.
- **Not suitable for general-purpose access**: Finding arbitrary elements is \(O(n)\).

### Use Cases
- Priority queues.
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., heapsort).

---

## Graphs

### Overview
- A set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.

### Types of Graphs
1. **Directed/Undirected**.
2. **Weighted/Unweighted**.
3. **Cyclic/Acyclic**.

### Advantages
- **Flexible representation**: Can represent a wide variety of relationships.
- **Efficient traversal**: BFS and DFS for exploring nodes.

### Disadvantages
- **Memory overhead**: Adjacency lists or matrices can consume a lot of memory.
- **Complex algorithms**: Many graph algorithms are computationally expensive.

### Use Cases
- Social networks.
- Shortest path problems (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s, A*).

| Binary Search Tree| \(O(\log n)\)| \(O(\log n)\)     | Medium          | Dynamic sets, search operations     |
| Graph             | \(O(n + e)\)| \(O(n + e)\)      | High            | Network flows, shortest paths       |
